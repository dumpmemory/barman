-   summary: Automatic bucket creation added to barman-cloud-check-wal-archive
    description: |-
        The `barman-cloud-check-wal-archive` command now verifies whether the target bucket
        exists in the configured cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) and automatically creates it
        if it does not.

        Previously, automatic bucket creation was handled by `barman-cloud-backup`. This
        change restores compatibility with CloudNativePG (CNPG) automations that depend on
        this behavior, which were affected after the release of Barman 3.16.0.

        In collaboration with the CloudNativePG team, we have reintroduced this
        functionality specifically in `barman-cloud-check-wal-archive` to ensure seamless
        operation of CNPG workflows and internal tests â€” all while preserving the intended
        behavior and simplicity for regular Barman users.
